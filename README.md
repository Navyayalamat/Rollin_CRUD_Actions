📌 Node.js Task Manager

A full-stack Task Management Application demonstrating CRUD actions, form validations, and engineering best practices such as maintainable code structure, pragmatic design choices, error handling, and unit testing.

✨ Features
Core Functionality

➕ Create: Add tasks with title, description, created date, and due date.

📖 Read: View all tasks in a responsive table.

✏️ Update: Edit existing tasks and completion status.

🗑️ Delete: Remove tasks from the list.

Validations & Error Handling

Required fields: title, description, created date, due date.

Due date cannot be before created date.

Unique task title validation.

Inline error messages displayed next to fields.

Centralized error handling in Node.js backend.

Engineering Best Practices

🏗️ Code Readability & Maintainability: Modular structure (React Context for state, separation of concerns).

🔄 Legacy Code Ready: Can integrate with existing codebases due to simple and decoupled design.

⚡ Node.js Upgrades: Written in modern JavaScript/TypeScript with ES modules and async/await.

🧩 Pragmatic Design Choices: Lightweight dependencies, minimal boilerplate, easy to scale.

🛡️ Validation & Error Handling both on frontend (React form) and backend (Node.js API).

✅ Unit Testing for CRUD operations, form validation, and error handling.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Context API, Bootstrap

Backend: Node.js, Express

Testing: Jest + React Testing Library (frontend), Mocha/Chai (backend)


🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Navyayalamat/Rollin_CRUD_Actions.git
cd Rollin_CRUD_Actions

2️⃣ Install dependencies
npm install

3️⃣ Run the project

npm run dev

🧪 Unit Testing
Run tests:

Backend (Node.js)

Test CRUD APIs.

Validate error handling (e.g., invalid input, duplicate task title).

Ensure proper status codes (200, 400, 404, 500).

Run tests:

npm test
